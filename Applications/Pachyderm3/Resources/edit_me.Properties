#=======================================================================================
### OVERVIEW
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	This is a Pachyderm3 configuration file. It is heavily annotated to give you
# guidance in editing it to correctly configure your Pachy3 installation.  Once you
# are done editing it, you should keep a copy; so if you need to reinstall Pachyderm
# again, for some reason, you won't need to recreate this file.
#
# If you need more context for understanding this file, read the "INSTALL" document.
#
# This file contains a collection of 'property' names and values (name = value pairs)
# which need to be set properly for a new (or upgraded) Pachyderm installation to run.
#
# On each active line below (where there is no leading "#"), there is a name = value pair.
# Replace the [explanatory text] with the appropriate value for your computer or server.
#
# In some cases a value will already been entered for a property.  This is because the
# value for that property is very common and changing it to something else would be very
# unusual.  Leave these values alone unless you are sure they need to be changed for your
# server.
#
#   NOTE: the values you provide must not end with blank characters unless that
# is intentional -- trailing blanks are treated as part of the value -- be careful.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#========================================================================================
### RENAMING THIS FILE
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   If you haven't done so already, your first step is to rename this file with the name
# of your app server hostmane.  You retrieved  this from your terminal window output as
# part of the installation process so far.  For example: edit_me.Properties is renamed
# to my-server.Properties. NOTE: your server name must be in all lowercase.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#========================================================================================
### MICROSOFT WINDOWS USERS
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Windows refers to file locations using a "\" file separator, and other systems use
# a "/".  Pachyderm operates successfully in both circumstances but it needs to be given
# two locations: where temporary files can be stored and where log files can be stored.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# p30.TemporaryDir.@envo.apache                                \\tmp\\Pachyderm\\
# log4j.appender.A2.file.@envo.apache        \\var\\log\\WebObjects\\Pachy30A.log

# p30.TemporaryDir.@envo.tomcat                         @@catalina.home@@\\temp\\
# log4j.appender.A2.file.@envo.tomcat       @@catalina.home@@\\logs\\Pachy30T.log

#========================================================================================
### WEB SERVER INFORMATION
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Pachyderm needs to know about the web server that will be serving up assets to
# users.  In production, with Apache or Tomcat, there is a base directory (document
# root - docroot) which is used for this.
#
#   The typical Pachyderm installation keeps all its assets separate from any other
# web site materials in its own folder in docroot.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

web.hostport = [ the TCP/IP port for the server -- 80 for Apache, 8080 for Tomcat ]
web.pachydir = [ the name of the Pachyderm folder inside docroot -- eg: pachyassets ]

file.docroot = [ the absolute path of pachy assets base -- eg: /var/log/html/@@web.pachydir@@ ]

#========================================================================================
### DATABASE INFORMATION
#
#   You must have MySQL installed and running on your computer/server, and Pachyderm needs
# to be able to access it to make changes to continue with the configuration.  You must
# have a MySQL user set up with the privileges to create tables and change their contents.
# Once this has been set up, you will have the information needed to replace the text in
# brackets below for the database parameters.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

db.username = [ the id of the MySQL user that has write access to 'db.database' ]
db.password = [ the password of the MySQL user ]
db.database = [ the name of the database in which Pachyderm will create tables ]
db.hostname = localhost

#========================================================================================
### RELEASING STARTUP BLOCKS
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	The first two parameters below keep Pachyderm3 from starting up fully while you
# set parameters and check whether they are working properly.
#
#	Leave the first one (pachy.exitAfterInitialize) set TRUE until you are confident
# you have set all the parameters in this file correctly.  As long as this parameter
# is TRUE the application will start, log a lot of information, and quit.  When the
# last line of that reads:
#
#    - [APPLICATION] EXIT AFTER INITIALIZING [pachy.exitAfterInitialize == true]
#
# you can set the first of the two parameters below to FALSE.
#
#   NOTE 1: Once 'pachy.exitAfterInitialize' is set FALSE, Pachyderm WILL attempt to
# make changes in your database, so be as sure MySQL is running and is as ready for that.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pachy.exitAfterInitialize = TRUE

#========================================================================================
### RELEASING 2ND STARTUP BLOCK
#
#   The second parameter below (pachy.exitBeforeLaunching) allows Pachyderm to run
# further to set up its MySQL database (creating tables and entering preliminary data)
# before quitting.  Again, you can run this way repeatedly, if you need to, in order to
# refine any settings.
#
#   You are likely to get assorted errors from MySQL when you do this.  Read them and
# adjust the settings in this file till the logged output from your runs shows no errors
# and ends:
#
#    - [APPLICATION] EXIT AFTER INITIALIZING [pachy.exitBeforeLaunching == true]
#
# At that point you can set this parameter (pachy.exitBeforeLaunching) to FALSE.
#
#	NOTE 2: These two parameters are preset to be TRUE to avoid accidents.  Be careful
# to only set each of them to FALSE when you are ready to do so.
#
#   The next time you run it you should have a working Pachyderm on your hands, and you
# should return to reading the "INSTALL" document.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pachy.exitBeforeLaunching = TRUE

#end

#========================================================================================
### SAMPLE SETTINGS
#
#    The lines below are all commented out and so are invisible to Pachyderm when it
# runs.  If the leading "#" were removed, they would become active and would set values
# for parameters. They are given here as an example of what this file might look after
# you have edited it -- they are SAMPLE values, do not use them; in fact, be safe and
# delete everything below the "#END" line above after you have read this in case you
# accidentally remove one of those "#" characters.

# pachy.exitAfterInitialize = FALSE
# er.migration.migrateAtStartup = TRUE
# pachy.exitBeforeLaunching = FALSE
# db.username = mysqladmin
# db.password = asecret
# db.database = pachydb
# db.hostname = localhost
# web.pachydir = pachyassets
# web.hostport = 80
